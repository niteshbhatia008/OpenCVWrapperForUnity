# OpenCV Wrapper for Unity
This project is provided for implementing simple Computer Vision (CV) and Digital Image Processing (DIP) functions in C++ and using them inside Unity.
Since Unity is comparatively slower in executing matrix-based operations, functions are called from a DLL to speed up DIP and CV tasks.

The Visual studio projects folders contains code for generating the DLL.
All dependencies are included in the folders and are linked properly.

NOTE: Since git does not allow uploading files > 100 MB, the following files were compressed to save the hassle.

opencv_world400.dll
opencv_world400d.dll

These files appear in the following directories. Please unzip the BEFORE you try out any project.
